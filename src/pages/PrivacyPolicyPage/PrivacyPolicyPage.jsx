              Data Controller. (This might be the hosting of a site containing
              personal data, for example, or providing an email-marketing service
              that facilitates mass distribution of marketing material to a Data
              Controller’s customer base.) <br /> Personal Information: in this
              privacy notice, we refer to your personal data as ‘personal
              information’. ‘Personal information’ means any information from

              information that has been anonymised. <br /> Special Information:

              protection under data protection law. Sensitive data includes
              information relating to health, racial and ethnic origin, political
              opinions, religious and similar beliefs, trade union membership, sex
              life and sexual orientation and also includes genetic information
              and biometric information.

            <h2>Details of how and why we use personal information</h2>
            <p>
              We are only able to use your personal information for certain legal
              reasons set out in data protection law. There are legal reasons
              under data protection law other than those listed below; but, in
              most cases, we will use your personal information for the following
              legal reasons:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal">
              <li>
                <strong>Contract Reason</strong>: this is in order to perform our
                obligations to you under a contract we have entered into with you;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legitimate Interests Reason</strong>: this is where the
                use of your personal information is necessary for our (or a third
                party’s) legitimate interests, so long as that legitimate interest
                does not override your fundamental rights, freedoms or interests;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legal Obligation Reason</strong>: this is where we have to
                use your personal information in order to perform a legal
                obligation by which we are bound; and
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consent Reason</strong>: this is where you have given us
                your consent to use your personal information for a specific
                reason or specific reasons.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              As explained above, there are more sensitive types of personal data,
              which require higher levels of protection. Where we process such
              sensitive types of personal data, we will usually do this in the
              following circumstances:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal">
              <li>We have your explicit consent;</li>
              <li>Where it is necessary in relation to legal claims;</li>
              <li>Where you have made the personal data public.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              So that we are able to provide you with services, we will need your
              personal information. If you do not provide us with the required
              personal information, we may be prevented from services to you.
              <br />
              It is important that you keep your personal information up to date.
              If any of your personal information changes, please contact us as
              soon as possible to let us know. If you do not do this, then we may
              be prevented from supplying services, to you.
              <br />
              Where we rely on consent for a specific purpose as the legal reason
              for processing your personal information, you have the right under
              data protection law to withdraw your consent at any time. If you do
              wish to withdraw your consent, please contact us using the details
              set out at the beginning of this notice. If we receive a request
              from you withdrawing your consent to a specific purpose, we will
              stop processing your personal information for that purpose, unless
              we have another legal reason for processing your personal
              information – in which case, we will confirm that reason to you.
              <br />
              We explain below the different purposes for which we use your
              personal information and, in each case, the legal reason(s) allowing
              us to use your personal information. Please also note the following:

            <ol className="list-decimal">
              <li>
                If we use the Legitimate Interests Reason as the legal reason for
                which we can use your personal information, we also explain what
                that legitimate interest is; and
